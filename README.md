# Basic syntax highlighting for Jasmin in Emacs

Basic Emacs syntax highlighting for Jasmin using font-lock (partially generated by ChatGPT). This also includes some highlighting for jazzline, a Jasmin branch that aims to automaically generate proofs in Cryptoline. 

To install, place the `jasmin-mode.el` file into a directory such as `~/.emacs.d/lisp/` and add the following to your `.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```elisp
;; Jasmin
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/") ;; can be omitted if already present elsewhere
(require 'jasmin-mode)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.jinc\\'" . jasmin-mode))
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.jazz\\'" . jasmin-mode))
```
